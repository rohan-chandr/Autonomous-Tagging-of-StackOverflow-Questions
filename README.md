# Autonomous-Tagging-of-StackOverflow-Questions
## The Problem:
* We are given a dataset containing Stackoverflow questions.
* Given this dataset, we must build a predictive model predicting the tags for each new question encountered
* The predictive model(s) must have as high an accuracy as possible, given the dataset and itâ€™s limitations

## The Data:
The Stacksimple dataset is a set of StackOverFlow programming questions. It was compiled during 2006 and has a large subset of the entire database of questions on the website. It contains two files that are organized with columns containing the features common to each question.
The dataset consists of 2 CSV files: questions.csv which Contains the Id, CreationDate, ClosedDate, DeletionDate, Score, OwnerUserId, AnswerCount and a second file that contains the question tags mapped to the question ID.
 
* The dataset can be downloaded at https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stacklite
